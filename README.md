# Beer me!

## React Native project
This app uses a public api to display information 
Ongoing to learn the React Native platform, and NativeBase universal components.

To see the app, you will need to use the Expo Go app. 

Currently in development and primarily built for Android. Sharing a development for iOS has not worked yet. After downloading the app, enter the URL below into the 'Enter URL manually' option.
You can click the show project link, and from there, use the QR code instead of manually entering the URL in the Expo Go app to view the app.
